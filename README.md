# Knowledge Forum Project



## Background and Motivation

This project was developed as part of the requirements for my degree at the university of Haifa, under the supervision of Professor Yotam Hod. The primary goal of this project is to create a knowledge-sharing forum where users can interact, share information, and access various resources in a structured community environment. The platform is designed to support multiple communities, each with its own discussion rooms, resources, and courses to foster learning and engagement.
## Project Overview

1. User Registration/Login: Secure authentication using Firebase Authentication.
2. Profile Management: Users can view and update their personal information.
3. Communities and Discussion Rooms: Users can join different communities, participate in discussions, and collaborate.
4. Courses: Users can enroll in courses, view course materials, and access course-specific discussion rooms.
